To test the game either build the .apk and install on an Android device or connect an Android phone to the PC via Unity Remote 4.

Open TestScene located in "Assets" folder to view the current level.

Since Spess Shooter X is an improved version of my original Spess Shooter there are some scripts and assets no longer in use but still in the game folder.

Obsolete/Unused scripts and assets:

1)HSBColor.cs          - previously used as material for the player projectile. Replaced with laser from Volumetric Lines package.
2)RandomMaterialHue.cs - Script that relies on HSBColor.cs, currently unused since player projectile has been replaced.
3)SwipeSimpleCS.cs     - Unused
4)TiltAround.cs        - previous control script, this one is using the accelerometer. Replaced with NewTilt.cs
5)PinchZoom.cs         - Unused
6)RandomRotator.cs     - Currently unused since it clashes with the cell shaded look of the asteroids.
